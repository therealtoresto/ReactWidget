Task: 
Create a React app containing Users widget. It should have two states:
1.	First state shows the users list. By default it shows three items. 
If there are more than three it shows a “View all” button. Which expands the rest of the list when clicked on it. Each item has an avatar, short user information and a “View” button. Design example:

 ![First state example](/state_1.png)

2.	Second state shows full user information after clicking on “View” button. It has a “Close” button to go back to the Users list. Button “Send message” does nothing. Design example:

  ![First state example](/state_2.png)
